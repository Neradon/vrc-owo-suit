   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:uzair-ashraf/vrc-owo-suit.git
   cd vrc-owo-suit
   ```

1. Install Dependencies

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Run

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

1. Build a standalone executable

   This repository is setup with a Github action to compile the standalone executable. If you would like to compile it on your local machine you can read the action for the command via `pyinstaller` [here](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Setting up your avatar

If this your first time working with OSC head over to the [VRChat docs to learn more](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview).

This doc assumes you have a Unity Package with an avatar already set up to be published to VRChat along with some knowledge of how to use Unity.

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/uzair-ashraf/vrc-owo-suit/releases) page and download the unity package from the latest release.

1. Open your Unity Project with your avatar.

1. Import the unity package from the latest release.

1. In the toolbar click `Shadoki > OWOSuit`, add your avatar to the field, and click add.

1. Place the newly generated game objects in the armature of your avatar. In a future update I expect to automatically place them in the generation, but for the initial release you will have to do it manually. Keep in mind the names of your bones may differ, but their placements should just match where they would be on your body.

   - Place both `owo_suit_Lumbar_R` and `owo_suit_Lumbar_L` into your Hip Bone.

      </p>

   - Place `owo_suit_Abdominal_R`, `owo_suit_Abdominal_L`, `owo_suit_Dorsal_R`, and `owo_suit_Dorsal_L` into your Spine Bone.

      <p align="center">

      </p>

   - Place `owo_suit_Pectoral_L` and `owo_suit_Pectoral_R` into your corresponding Breast bones. If you do not have Breast bones, then your Chest bone will suffice.

      </p>

   - Place `owo_suit_Arm_R` and `owo_suit_Arm_L` into your corresponding UpperArm bones.

      </p>

   - (OPTIONAL) Add a parameter called "owo_intensity" to the avatar parameters and also add it to the menu with a radial control.

1. Every avatar is different in size therefore every avatar's collissions will be different. Go through each game object starting with `owo_suit` and adjust the `VRC Contact Receiver` script to change the size of the capsule collider. This is where the detection will occur, so you can make the area for each collision bigger or smaller if you'd like.

   In the example below you can see that this contact is for the right abdomen. I adjusted the capsule size to map out the right portion of the abdomen.
